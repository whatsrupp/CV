I am an enthusiastic fullstack developer with a mechanical engineering background and a strong academic track record. I use practical engineering and coding skills to look at problems from a grounded technical and user-led perspective. I enjoy learning, responsibility and driven but fun work environments.


## Projects

**Jelly** (July 2017 - Present)

Having enjoyed working at IINU (now called Jelly), a small startup who 'Make chefs' lives easier', for the summer of 2017 as a front end developer. I stayed on during university working part time remotely to keep coding. After university, I took on a full time role as the lead developer with responsibilities such as:

- Managing the company's AWS infrastructure
- Maintaining a Nancy Based C# REST api
- Talking to clients to keep the focus on user driven project development
- Job interviews and hiring decisions
- Helping the company plot a product roadmap
- Optimizing Front End Performance with Webpack
- Managing a continuous integration pipeline and an EC2 server
- Containerising local development environments and minimising developer set up time
- Writing a fully unit tested Graphql-Express node api.
- Co-developing and architecting a clean, scalable front-end React app with a heavy focus on testing

Today, chefs and their kitchens around London, from boutique to Michelin, are managing their dishes, ordering food and understanding if they're profitable quickly and without stress with the app!

Tech Stack: React, GraphQL, Node, Nancy, Mongodb, AWS Lambda, AWS EC2, NGINX.

#### Extra Projects

###### Video Editing and Production

I find video production engaging due to the balance between creative and technical thought. I have spent an extensive amount of time writing, filming and editing videos on both a commercial freelance basis or for personal interest. I was involved with Bath University’s media society, filming promotional material or creating short films.

###### A Cappella Marketing

I used to be heavily involved with a competitive a cappella group, Aquapella, placing 2nd /3rd in two national competitions (VFUK, ICCA). I was responsible for the branding and marketing of our two Edinburgh Fringe Recommended Shows. This included the design of the poster, the design of the merchandise and liaising with the venue.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (March - June 2017)

The marketing team at Makers pitch it as 'Learning to code in 12 weeks' and I definitely learnt Javascript and Ruby to a good standard. However, having gone through the process, I think the main value I took from a bootcamp like Makers were the values and culture I picked up from it.
It taught me how to be a pro-active and independent learner in order to deal with problems that initially seem unsolvable. It taught me how to collaborate and work in a group environment. Finally, it taught me how to be excited about work.

As a summary, over the 3 months I was exposed to:

| Area                 | Technologies                                                                                              |

| Testing Frameworks   | Rspec, Capybara, Mocha, Jasmine, Zombie                                                                   |
| Approaches           | Test Driven Development, Object Orientated Programming, SOLID prinicples, Extreme Programming(XP) values. |

#### University of Bath (2014 - 2018)

BEng (hons) Mechanical Engineering: 1st Class Honours.

#### Sevenoaks School

IB Diploma (2013): 43/45 Total with full marks in Higher level subjects of Maths, Physics and Design 2010-2012

## Additional Work Experience

**Premier Model Management** (Sept 2014 - August 2019)
Involvement with the fashion industry was a great opportunity to earn money whilst pursuing my university interests. The improvement of time-management skills, ability to deal with rejection and increased confidence with meeting new clients around Europe have been invaluable.

**Delphi Diesel Systems** (September 2013 - June 2015)
Delphi’s Stonehouse branch is a high-volume production facility for precision fuel injectors, specialising in micron level finishing. As a manufacturing systems engineer I was given control of and improved a finishing lathe, the loader that fed the lathe and an end of line electrical test machine. The streamlining and correction of the electrical test process saved Delphi £100,000+ per annum and meant I reached the Year in Industry Contribution to Business awards regional finals.

**Lotus Formula 1 Enstone** (1 week in July 2012)
I worked on a team that responsible for a hydraulic transmission dynamometer designed to run endurance testing experiments of the F1 gearboxes and clutch. I was asked to construct a model which, when given the front wheel / engine RPM and the car's gear ratios, could work out which gear was being used as well as acceleration, velocity and distance at any point.
