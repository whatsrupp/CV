I am an enthusiastic fullstack developer with a mechanical engineering background. I use practical engineering and coding skills to look at problems from a grounded technical and user-led perspective. I enjoy learning, responsibility and driven but fun work environments.

## Projects

**LandTech** (November 2019 - Present)

I stumbled accross LandTech because it looked fun (The hiring video had the CEO pretending to wind people up by mopping the floor) And fun it is. I'm currently helping pipe government land data onto maps to help people find places to build things.

I've had two roles here so far. Both have been very heavily back end, data and infrastructure based which has been a fantastic learning experience.

_Fullstack Data Engineer_

- Coordinating and improving the scheduling of our 360+ web scrapers.
- Simplify our core data pipeline that processes data on UK based planning applications from webscrapers

_Fullstack Business and Operations Engineer_

I was allowed to join this very small team as I was interested in what goes on in the inner workings of a business that's going through growth.

I set up our full internal business data pipeline. Daily, it ingests business critical sales, financial and user data into a warehouse via scraping, apis or remote file downloads. Once in place, I set up DBT to transform and enrich the data so that they can be used in our AWS Quicksight dashboards used by the C-suite.

In more of an SRE project, I simplified our company user sessions management by unifying our login and session persistance across our 5 different projects into a single session concept. All company traffic now routes through a centralised gateway which enriches both internal and external requests with user metadata which means teams don't need to worry about logins, accounts and sessions and can focus on writing features.

_Other_
Hosting a weekly company wide call with 100+ people in it.
Starting a culture of giving short non-work related talks (Zip Talks) to the company.

If you want a less formal flavour of what I got up to in my first year at LandTech I wrote a [blog post](https://engineering.land.tech/a-year-later/) about it!

Tech Stack: Vue, GraphQL, Node, Python, Mongodb, Postgres, DBT, Cloudformation (CDK), Docker, Kubernetes, Bash, Bats, Cypress, CircleCi, AWS EC2, NGINX, Github Actions.
(For more info, we maintain a more detailed list of our Tech Stack [here](https://engineering.land.tech/radar/))


**Jelly** (July 2017 - November 2019)

Having enjoyed working at IINU (now called Jelly), a small startup who 'Make chefs' lives easier', for the summer of 2017 as a front end developer. I stayed on during university working part time remotely to keep coding. After university, I took on a full time role as the lead developer with responsibilities such as:

- Managing the company's AWS infrastructure
- Maintaining a Nancy Based C# REST api
- Talking to clients to keep the focus on user driven project development
- Job interviews and hiring decisions
- Helping the company plot a product roadmap
- Optimizing Front End Performance with Webpack
- Managing a continuous integration pipeline and an EC2 server
- Containerising local development environments and minimising developer set up time
- Writing a fully unit tested Graphql-Express node api.
- Co-developing and architecting a clean, scalable front-end React app with a heavy focus on testing

Today, hundreds of chefs and their kitchens around London, from boutique to Michelin, are managing their dishes, ordering food and understanding if they're profitable quickly and without stress with the app!

Tech Stack: React, GraphQL, Node, Nancy, Mongodb, AWS Lambda, AWS EC2, NGINX.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (March - June 2017)

The marketing team at Makers pitch it as 'Learning to code in 12 weeks' and I definitely learnt Javascript and Ruby to a good standard. However, having gone through the process, I think the main value I took from a bootcamp like Makers were the values and culture I picked up from it.
It taught me how to be a pro-active and independent learner in order to deal with problems that initially seem unsolvable. It taught me how to collaborate and work with a team of developers. Finally, it taught me about how well written code and testing can enable ideas to scale across a team.

#### University of Bath (2014 - 2018)

BEng (hons) Mechanical Engineering: 1st Class Honours.

#### Sevenoaks School

IB Diploma (2013): 43/45 Total with full marks in Higher level subjects of Maths, Physics and Design 2010-2012
IGCSEs (2011) : 11 Subjects 9A\*, 1A, 1B

## Additional Work Experience

**Premier Model Management** (Sept 2014 - August 2019)
Involvement with the fashion industry was a great opportunity to earn money whilst pursuing my university interests. The improvement of time-management skills, ability to deal with rejection and increased confidence with meeting new clients around Europe have been invaluable.

**Delphi Diesel Systems** (September 2013 - June 2015)
Delphi’s Stonehouse branch is a high-volume production facility for precision fuel injectors, specialising in micron level finishing. As a manufacturing systems engineer I was given control of and improved a finishing lathe, the loader that fed the lathe and an end of line electrical test machine. The streamlining and correction of the electrical test process saved Delphi £100,000+ per annum and meant I reached the Year in Industry Contribution to Business awards regional finals.

**Lotus Formula 1 Enstone** (1 week in July 2012)
I worked on a team that responsible for a hydraulic transmission dynamometer designed to run endurance testing experiments of the F1 gearboxes and clutch. I was asked to construct a model which, when given the front wheel / engine RPM and the car's gear ratios, could work out which gear was being used as well as acceleration, velocity and distance at any point.
